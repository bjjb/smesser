{"name":"SMeSseR","body":"### Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'smesser'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install smesser\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nSmesser is generally supposed to be used as part of a more useful application,\r\nfor sending (free!) SMSs.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, come with a little command-line application (`smesser`). Try\r\n`smesser -h` when it's installed.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nYou can program Smesser programatically, but it will also\r\nhave a look for some configuration files, and determine the\r\nusername/password/provider from there. These config files are loaded, in order,\r\nif they exist:\r\n\r\n* /etc/smesserrc\r\n* /usr/local/etc/smesserrc\r\n* ~/.smesserrc\r\n\r\n*HINT*: If you're a command-line type of person (which I presume yuo are, as\r\nyou're reading this), then add a \"contacts\" hash to your configuration file.\r\nThese can be used as aliases instead of phone number.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample configuration file, which you'd keep as ~/.smesserrc\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nprovider: o2.ie\r\nusername: \"0861234567\" # <-- Ensure a string, or the leading 0 could vanish!\r\npassword: secret\r\ncontacts:\r\n  mom: \"+3538712345678\"\r\n  dad: \"+1123456788\"\r\n  lisa: \"08517171717\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Providers\r\n\r\nThe core of Smesser is done by little [Mechanize][mechanize] agents, called\r\nProviders, that know how to log in (as you) to a specific website, fill in a\r\nform, and submit it.\r\n\r\nThe only requirements for a Provider is that it responds to `login` and `send`.\r\nBy subclassing Smesser::Provider, you get a couple of convenience methods to\r\nhelp you create your own.\r\n\r\nHave a look at bundled providers for info on how to write your own provider.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there's\r\n\r\n* vodafone.ie\r\n* o2.ie\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
